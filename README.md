Introduction to programing
====
This course provides an introduction to programing using python. We will not only focuses on the primary features of python but also issues of programing design and development.  Some python specific topics include: control structures, primitive types, containers, functions, classes and some of python’s more advanced features such as list comprehension and decorators.  Students will build and maintain their own cloud servers, using them as their primary development workstation.  In doing so students not only learn to write code but also gain an understanding of  unix/linux operating systems.
